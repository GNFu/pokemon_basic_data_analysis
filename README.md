# Introduction
A newbie friendly python data analysis project using jupyter notebook.

# Data Description
The dataset used in the project is a simplified version of pokemon data, which includes: Name, Total, HP, Attack, Defence, Sp. Atk, Sp. Def, Speed, and Legendary.

# Purpose of the project
The project is one of the cases listed in my book "Python 101 for Business School Student", thus it is meant to be instructive for beginners. Try to play with these codes and understand what is happenning when you run them.

# Project Content
Apart from regular analysis procedures, the project uses plotly.express to visualize the ranking of different types of pokemons. 3D plot is introduced to display the distribution of individual pokemon according to their attributes. Finally, the project use decision tree model to predict if a pokemon is legendary or not. And the visualization of the decision tree model is made to facilitate the understanding of this little tiny machine learning.
